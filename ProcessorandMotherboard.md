A computer processor is the most imporant part of a computer. Think of it as the brain of the computer, it handles every process and system that the computer takes care of. A powerful Processor is a must. Again, I personally prefer Nvidia products over amd for the reasons stated in the graphics card page.

A motherboard is arguably the second most important part in a computer as it holds all the important circuits to transmit data and holds all the brackets to mount the parts to your computer.
