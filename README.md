### How to build your own computer
The Digital world is exanpding every minute of every day, and computers are becoming more and more every day essentials.
In this tutorial I will explore the many options of building your own computer in hopes to help anyone with little experience to make this process much easier.
For this tutorial the target will be a broad audience, as almost any age can build and use a computer. The growing use of technology enables a very broad audience to be in need of a computer, therefore making this knowledge as public as possible and easy to access is something important we should start passing along.
I will list the vital parts of a computer that you should look for below:
1. SSD and Ram
2. Graphics card 
3. Processor and Motherboard
4. Computer Case and Power Supply
